# We should compare groups of humans to an integrated AI network, not individuals to one AI instance
While an individual AI may significantly outperform an individual human in a given instance, this is not where the superiority of artificial super intelligence ends. AI also has a significant edge when it comes to connectivity. Many AIs can be seamlessly integrated into a vast network that efficiently communicates with itself in a lossless and super-fast manner.

The communication between two human drivers at an intersection is very limited, so accidents can easily occur. This is why we need traffic control systems like traffic lightsâ€”to curb the need for communication. Two AI-driven cars, on the other hand, can communicate at light speed and act congruently after split-second calculations have been made. This means that there are instances where the connectivity AI compounds the benefits at the individual level, creating an emergent organism that adds up to more than the sum of its parts.
