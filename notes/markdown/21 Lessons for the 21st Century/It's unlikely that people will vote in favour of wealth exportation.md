# It's unlikely that people will vote in favour of wealth exportation
As [[Automation will lead to wealth concentration]], UBI proposes a system whereby wealth is redistributed from billionaires to (ex) working class people who have lost their jobs. However, the wealth generated by American tech entrepreneurs is not likely to be willfully exported to developing countries under the banner of UBI once the low-skilled jobs that the people in those countries used to work are lost. It is unlikely for western citizens to vote in favour of such an exportation of wealth, calling into question what *'Universal'* really means.
