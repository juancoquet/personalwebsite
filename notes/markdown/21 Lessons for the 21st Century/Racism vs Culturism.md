# Racism vs Culturism
While discrimination based on skin colour used to commonly occur, this is rarely the case anymore. Instead, it is much more common to criticise 'outsiders' based on cultural norms than on any biological trait. While there was never much scientific evidence in support of the advantages and disadvantages of particular biological races, there are plenty of reasons to believe that certain cultures may, at least in certain contexts, be better than others.

In the job market, for example, a native with local culture may be better suited for a managerial position than an outsider whose cultural norms may create tensions with other local colleagues. In such situations, it is not the biological traits of the individual that are being discriminated againstâ€”it's cultural incompatibility.
