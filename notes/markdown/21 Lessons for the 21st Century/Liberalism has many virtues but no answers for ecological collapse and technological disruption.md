# Liberalism has many virtues but no answers for ecological collapse and technological disruption
In the past, liberalism provided an answer to societal problems by promising economic growth. The working classes were content coexisting with the upper classes so long as everyone's slice of the pie was growing. Same with the religious and the non-religious and other dichotomies. It has a better record than any of its alternatives.

However, the problems of ecological collapse and technological disruption are not addressed by economic growthâ€”they are in fact *caused* by economic growth, so liberalism has not been able to come up with an answer for dealing with these issues.
