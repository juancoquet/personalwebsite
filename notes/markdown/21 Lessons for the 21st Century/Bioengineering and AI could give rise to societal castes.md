# Bioengineering and AI could give rise to societal castes
As advancements are made in bioengineering and AI, society's rich could find themselves with access to upgrades to their cognitive abilities as well as their health. This could create a runaway effect, where an already large gap between rich and poor becomes unbridgeable due to a fundamental difference in competence of those involved.

As the rich become more competent due to upgrades, they are able to outperform the regular masses thereby creating an unbridgeable gap. Governments could be uninterested in investing in a useless populace, as their labour has been replaced by AI.
