# Automation will lead to wealth concentration
As more and more industries become automated, jobs are lost and the wealth that was once earned by workers will only reside in the pockets of those leading the automation chargeâ€”tech entrepreneurs. Not only will this concentration of wealth occur between classes, but also between countries. Currently, western technology organisations employ factory workers and call centre workers in the east. As these low-skilled labour jobs become automated, the wealth that is currently going to those countries will cease. Will Western citizens agree to legislation that exports taxed wealth to other countries once this happens?
