# Religion vs science & globalisation
In contrast to religion, the mark of science is that the scientist admits to their mistakes and forms a new hypothesis, adapting to correct their previous misunderstanding. This is why science gives rise to things that actually *work* while religion is stranded in the world of metaphor and flexible interpretations.

As science progresses and discoveries are made, cultures all around the world adopt these discoveries in all areasâ€”medicine, agriculture, engineeringâ€”in order to benefit from them, leading to increased globalisation. Religion struggles to give rise to these universally accepted answers to problems due to their subjective interpretation.
