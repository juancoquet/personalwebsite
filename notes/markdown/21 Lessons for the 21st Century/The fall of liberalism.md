# The fall of liberalism
In the year 2016, Donald Trump and the Brexit vote signified the wave of disillusionment in the liberal story reaching the heart of European and American states. From three stories to choose from in 1938 (see [[Three ideologies of the 20th century]]), now down to zero.

Going from a single, clear storyâ€”the most reassuring situation possibleâ€”to no story at all is a frightening change. The way we interpret the world has been called into question. Liberals, still sure of their story, interpret this change as nothing short of apocalypticâ€”as though history departing from their core beliefs must mean that we are surely heading for Armageddon.
