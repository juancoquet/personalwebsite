# Pearl Harbor motivations
Through indoctrination into the state Shinto (an adaptation of ancient Japanese religions), the Japanese state fostered fervent loyalty from its populace. By taking old religions and myths, and adapting them to mix well with modern science, they created a very strong Japanese identity that the people were willing to lay down their lives for.

In 1941, Japanese kamikaze attacks descended on the American fleet in Pearl Harborâ€”an attack that consisted of regular planes loaded with bombs, and human pilots that were willing to make a one-way trip in the name of their Japanese identity.
