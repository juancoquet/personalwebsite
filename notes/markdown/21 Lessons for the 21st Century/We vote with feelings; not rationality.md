# We vote with feelings; not rationality
The 2016 Brexit referendum is an example of how our political decisions are madeâ€”through feeling, not rationality. The idea that the layman could have made an informed vote on leaving the EU is preposterousâ€”he simply doesn't have the knowledge of law macroeconomics. Of the vote, Richard Dawkins said "You might as well call a nationwide plebiscite to decide whether Einstein got his algebra right, or let passengers vote on which runway the pilot should land." It is for this reason, that we vote with our feelings, that our votes can be exploited in the future by an algorithm that knows how to 'push the right buttons'.
