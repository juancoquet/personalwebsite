# Communism is bankrupt for dealing with automation of jobs
Twentieth century communism valued the working class and the importance that they had in the economy. Without the working class, it is true that the economy could not function. It attempted to use this fact to compel the working class to demand more for themselves and dispel oligarchs through a proletariat revolution.

We have somehow seen a resurgence in communist ideas within the past decade, but it seems that the answers provided by communism could not be more ill-fitting for the issues that we will be facing in the near future. As job automation increases, the problem becomes that the working class becomes irrelevantâ€”without the working class being the power that drives the economy, communism loses its central bargaining chip entirely.
