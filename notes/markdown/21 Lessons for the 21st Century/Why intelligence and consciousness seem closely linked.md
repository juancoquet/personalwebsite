# Why intelligence and consciousness seem closely linked
Loosely described, intelligence is a facility that helps us solve problems. Consciousness, on the other hand, is a facility that allows us to feel and experience. In humans and other mammals we observe a seemingly strong correlation between these two facilities because it is our feelings that help us solve problems ([[Feelings are not the opposite of rationality, they are evolutionary rationality]])â€”a biochemical process gives rise to an emotion that leads to an action that will hopefully solve our problem.
