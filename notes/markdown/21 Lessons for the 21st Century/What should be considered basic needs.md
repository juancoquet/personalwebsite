# What should be considered basic needs
Although basic biological needs are obvious and well understood, what we really consider basic human needs, or basic human rights, is in flux. Do basic needs stop at food and water in an hyper-interconnected world, or should it also include internet access? When Biotechnology develops and we are able to significantly enhance human capabilitiesâ€”physical and cognitiveâ€”should basic needs extend beyond fundamental biological needs in order to keep things fair? What about access to education? And even therein, what level of education should be freely accessible to all?
