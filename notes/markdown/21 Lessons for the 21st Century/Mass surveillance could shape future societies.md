# Mass surveillance could shape future societies
With biometric technology improving, it is possible that the future could be characterised by a level of surveillance that not even George Orwell could have imagined. Face recognition technology can monitor emotional responses. We have wearable devices that can measure our heart rate, blood oxygen and glucose levels. It is only a matter of time until these devices make their way under our skin and gain access to far greater data. While such levels of surveillance can have fantastic benefits, such as health improvements or tracking in case of emergencies, they are also fettered to huge malevolent potential if used for the wrong reasons. Advanced biometrics could be the greatest weapon of a dictatorship government.
