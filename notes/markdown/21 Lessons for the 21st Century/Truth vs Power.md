# Truth vs Power
Fictions have demonstrated far greater power to unify people than absolute truths. We gather together behind powerful ideasâ€”their veracity becomes nothing more than an afterthought.

Truth and power together can only go so farâ€”if you seek to maximise power, at some point the truth must be forsaken and replaced with a powerful fiction. If you seek absolute truth, power must be forsaken as there will be no room for unifying fictions.
