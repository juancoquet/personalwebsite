# Technological disruption has not yet entered political discourse
We are still living with a political conversation centred around liberalism and its values and, while this may still be important, we have not begun to politically address the effects of disruptive technology.

Political conversation revolves around international interactionsâ€”border control, jobs being taken by foreigners, etc.â€”but we never talk about the interactions that humans will increasingly have with machines. It won't be foreigners taking jobs, it will be algorithmsâ€”and our leaders are still more concerned with foreign policy due to being stranded in the liberal story.
