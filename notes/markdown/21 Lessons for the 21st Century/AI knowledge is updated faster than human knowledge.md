# AI knowledge is updated faster than human knowledge
Comparing human doctors to hypothetical AI doctors, we can imagine scenarios where new medical discoveries are made. In such cases, it takes a long time for all human doctors to update their knowledge to account for the new information whereas a network of AI doctors can all be updated simultaneously in an instant. These compounding benefits that develop from the connectivity and update-ability of AI agents mean that even in cases where an individual human is better at a given job, it may still be better to replace all humans with AIs in order to access the benefits that come from the connectivity and update-ability of AI.
