# Humans are better at designing tools than using them wisely
We have historically been much better at the creative process of inventing new tools than we have been at the philosophical process of understanding how to use them wisely. We can invent smartphones and the internet, and make them commonplace tools before understanding what they will do to our psychology. We can invent dams to stop the flow of a river and build them before understanding the broader ecological impacts it will have. The same with fossil fuels.
