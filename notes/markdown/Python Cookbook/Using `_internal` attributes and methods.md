# Using `_internal` attributes and methods
Attributes and functions names with a single leasing underscore are considered *internal* or *protected*. This means that they serve some internal purpose for the class in which they belong, and should not be accessed by users of the code.

Python does not prevent a user from accessing these private names, but it is considered impolite to do so and can lead to fragile codeâ€”these names were made private by the author of the code for a reason.
```python

class A:
	def __init__(self):
		self._internal_ = 0
		self.public = 1
		
	def public_method(self):
		'''
		For users of the class to call
		'''
	
	def _internal_method(self):
		'''
		For internal use
		'''
	
```
