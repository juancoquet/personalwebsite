# Extending classes with mixins
[[What is a mixin?|Mixins]] can be used to add specific behaviour to many different classes. This is helpful when you have a fairly generic type of behaviour that you want to implement in several classes, but these classes don't necessarily have anything in common to allow them to share a base class. In such cases, a separate mixin class can be built and inherited from. Consider the following example, where a mixin class is created for only allowing a `key` to be set once.
```python
class SetOnceMixin:
	def __setitem__(self, key, value):
		if key in self:
			raise KeyError(str(key) + ' already set')
		return super().__setitem__(key, value)
```

This class is completely useless on its ownâ€”the lack of `__init__()` and the use of `super()` will raise errors if instantiated. However, when this mixin class is inherited from, the resulting class will not allow a `key` to be set more than once.
```python
class SetOnceDict(SetOnceMixin, dict):
	pass


d = SetOnceDict()
d['x'] = 1		# Creates a `x` key, sets value to 1
d['y'] = 2		# Creates a `y` key, sets value to 2
d['x'] = 3		# Raises KeyError, `x` is already set
```

An important thing to note is the use of `super()` within the mixin class. It seems like a strange implementation, since the mixin doesn't inherit from another class, yet without it the mixin wouldn't work. The `super()` call is responsible for delegating the `__setitem__()` call over to the `dict` class. If there was no multiple inheritance present, this would also cause the code to break. Mixins rely on the presence of other classesâ€”they rely on multiple inheritance. They piggyback onto another class (in this case `dict`) and add functionality to it.
