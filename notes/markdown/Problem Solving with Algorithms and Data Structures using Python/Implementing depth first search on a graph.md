# Implementing depth first search on a graph
A [[What is a depth first search?|depth first search]] (DFS) algorithm has a main function, `dfs`, and a helper function `dfs_visit` which calls itself recursively on the vertices of a [[What is a graph?|graph]]. We will implement both functions as methods of a `Graph` class, which will need some specific attributes to enable the functionality of the DFS algorithm. The `Vertex` objects that make up the graph will also need some specific attributes that the DFS algorithm utilises.

```python
class Vertex:

	def __init__(self, key):
		self.key = key
		self.connected_to = {}
		self.distance = 0
		self.visited = False
		self.fully_searched = False
		self.predecessor = None
		self.discovered = None
		self.finished = None
	  
	def add_connection(self, to_vertex, weight=0):
		self.connected_to[to_vertex] = weight
	  
	def __str__(self):
		return str(self.id) + 'connected to: ' + str([vertex.key for vertex in self.connected_to])
	  
	def get_connections(self):
		return self.connected_to.keys()
	  
	def get_key(self):
		return self.key
	  
	def get_weight(self, to_vertex):
		return self.connected_to[to_vertex]
	  
	 
	class Graph:
	  
	def __init__(self):
		self.vertices = {}
		self.num_vertices = 0
		self.time = 0
	  
	def add_vertex(self, key):
		new_vertex = Vertex(key)
		self.vertices[key] = new_vertex
		self.num_vertices += 1
		return new_vertex
	  
	def get_vertex(self, key):
		if key in self.vertices:
			return self.vertices[key]
		else:
			return None
	
	def __contains__(self, key):
		return key in self.vertices
	  
	def add_edge(self, from_vertex, to_vertex, weight=0):
		if from_vertex not in self.vertices:
			self.add_vertex(from_vertex)
		if to_vertex not in self.vertices:
			self.add_vertex(to_vertex)
		self.vertices[from_vertex].add_connection(self.vertices[to_vertex], weight)
	  
	def get_vertices(self):
		return self.vertices.keys()
	  
	def __iter__(self):
		return iter(self.vertices.values())
	
	def bfs(self, start_vertex):
		start_vertex.distance = 0
		to_search = Queue()
		to_search.enqueue(start_vertex)
		while to_search.size > 0:
			current_vx = to_search.dequeue()
			for neighbour in current_vx.get_connections():
				if not neighbour.visited:
					neighbour.visited = True
					neighbour.distance = current_vx.distance + 1
					neighbour.predecessor = current_vx
					to_search.enqueue(neighbour)
			current_vx.fully_searched = True
	  
	def traverse(self, vertex):
		while vertex.predecessor is not None:
			print(vertex.key)
		vertex = vertex.predecessor
			print(vertex.key)
```

The `Graph` class has the DFS-specific attribute `self.time`. This is a simple counter that is incremented with each step the algorithm takes, which is then used by the individual `Vertex` objects to keep a temporal track of when the DFS algorithm visited them.

The DFS-specific attributes of the `Vertex` class are `self.discovered` and `self.finished`.
- `self.discovered` remembers the value of the `Graph` class' `self.time` attribute when the DFS algorithm first visits the `Vertex` object.
- `self.finished` remembers the value of the `Graph` class' `self.time` attribute when the DFS algorithm finished exploring the `Vertex` object.

With these attributes in place, we can now define the `dfs` and `dfs_visit` methods.

```python
class Graph:

	[...]

	def dfs(self):
		for vertex in self:
			vertex.visited = False
			vertex.fully_searched = False
			vertex.predecessor = None
		for vertex in self:
			if not vertex.visited:
				self.dfs_visit(vertex)
	
	def dfs_visit(self, start_vertex):
		start_vertex.visited = True
		self.time += 1
		start_vertex.discovered = self.time
		for neighbour in start_vertex.get_connections():
			if not neighbour.visited:
				neighbour.predecessor = start_vertex
				self.dfs_visit(neighbour)
		start_vertex.fully_searched = True
		self.time += 1
		start_vertex.finished = self.time
```

The first line of the algorithm, `for vertex in self`, begins a loop of the values in the `Graph` object's `self.vertices` dictionary. These values are `Vertex` objects. Next we mark each vertex's `visited` and `fully_searched` attributes as `False` in case they were `True` from previous DFS/BFS calls, and also remove any predecessor pointers.

With all vertices reset, we can now begin the depth first traversal of the graph. We loop through each vertex in the graph once again, but this time we call the helper `dfs_visit` on each vertex if the algorithm has not visited it yet.

The `dfs_visit` recursive method is where the heavy lifting occurs. We begin by marking the vertex on which it is called as visited, then increment the `Graph` object's `time` attribute. Next we set the vertex's `discovered` attribute to the graph's current `time`, before starting a loop of the vertex's neighbouring vertices. Inside the loop, we first check if each neighbour has been visited. If it hasn't, we point its `predecessor` attribute to the current vertex, and recursively call `dfs_visit` on the neighbouring vertex. Since `dfs` reset all `visited` attributes earlier, all new nodes encountered will trigger a recursive call, meaning that the `dfs_visit` method will continually move through the graph to the first available neighbouring vertex until it encounters a vertex with only one neighbour, its predecessor, which has of course already been visited. At this point the loop through this 'dead end' vertex's neighbours ends as there are no more vertices to visit, and we mark the vertex as fully searched. Next we increment the `time`, and set the vertex's `finished` attribute to the graph's current `time`. The function call for this dead end vertex is now resolved and it is removed from the call [[What is a stack?|stack]], so the program returns to the `for neighbour...` loop in the previous call. If there were more neighbouring vertices to explore in the previous call, the `for` loop resumes to the next neighbour, otherwise the `for` loops end as it did with the dead end vertex, and the function call is resolved and removed from the call stack.

The following sequence of images demonstrates this process on a simple graph. Unseen vertices are coloured white, visited vertices are coloured grey, and fully searched vertices are coloured black. Underneath each vertex's name, the time each vertex was first visited (discovered) and fully searched (finished) are noted in the format `vistied/finished`. Edges that lead to nodes that have previously been visited (and therefore don't require further exploration) are represented by dotted arrows.
