# What is a map data type?
A map (or hashmap) is a data type that associates key/value pairs in an unordered structure. We use the key to look up the value associated with that key within the map. Keys must be unique, so each key pertains to only one value in the map.

Python has a built in map data type, the **dictionary**.
