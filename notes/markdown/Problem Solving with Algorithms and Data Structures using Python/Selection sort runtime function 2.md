# Selection sort runtime function
A selection sort, like a bubble sort, iterates through the $n$ items in the collection it's sorting $n-1$ times, so these nested loops give it a runtime function of $O(n^2)$. However, a selection sort doesn't need to perform as many swaps as a bubble sort, meaning that it actually runs considerably faster than a bubble sort in most cases.
