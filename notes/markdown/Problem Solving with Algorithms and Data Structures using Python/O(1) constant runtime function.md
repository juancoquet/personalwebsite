# O(1) constant runtime function
A constant runtime function is when an algorithms takes the same amount of time regardless of the size of input **n**.

As a toy example, here is a function that simply adds 1 to an input **n**. The runtime remains the same regardless of how big **n** becomes.

```python

def add_one(n):
	return n + 1

```
