# What is an adjacency list?
An adjacency list is a way of representing and implementing a [[What is a graph?|graph]] that is more space-efficient than an [[What is an adjacency matrix?|adjacency matrix]].

In an adjacency list implementation, the graph object holds a master list of all existing vertices and each vertex object holds its own local collection of all other vertices that it is connected to. A good datatype to use for this collection is a dictionary as we can set the keys to be the vertices and set the values to be the weight of the edge that leads to that particular vertex.

This is more space-efficient because no data needs to be stored for non-existing edges, unlike in an adjacency matrix where all possible edges need to be represented to maintain the properties of the matrix.
