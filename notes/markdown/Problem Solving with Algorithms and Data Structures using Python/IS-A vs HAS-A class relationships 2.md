# IS-A vs HAS-A class relationships
An IS-A relationship is when classes follow a hereditary structure. For example, if class `A` is subclassed by class `AChild`, then we can say that class `AChild` IS-A subclass of class `A`.

A HAS-A relationship is when a class uses another class, but it does not reside within that class' hierarchy. Suppose that class `B` 'holds' an instance of class `A` as a property value, then we would say that class `B` HAS-A class `A` instance.
