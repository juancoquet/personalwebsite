# What is a binary search tree?
A [[What is a binary search?|binary search]] tree inherits all the properties of a [[What is a binary tree?|binary tree]], but it has an added restraint whereby all children within the left subtree are smaller than the parent, and all children within the right subtree are greater than the parent. This structure propagates to all levels of the tree.
