# Operations of a map datatype
- `put(key, val)` adds a new key/value pair to the map. If the key already exists in the map, then its value is replaced with the newly supplied value.
- `get(key)` retrieves the value associated with the supplied key, or `None` if the key does not exist.
- `del` deletes a key/value pair from the map using the syntax `del my_map[key]`.
- `len()` returns the length of the map, i.e. the number of key/value pairs.
- `in` returns `True` if a given key exists in the map, or `False` otherwise. The syntax used is `key in my_map`.
