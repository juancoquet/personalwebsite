# Dijkstra's algorithm
Dijkstra's algorithm is used on [[What is a graph?|graphs]] to find the shortest path between two vertices. It is somewhat similar to a [[What is breadth first search?|breadth first search]] algorithm, so we must ensure that the `Vertex` class has certain attributes that allows it to operate (see [[Implementing breadth first search on a graph]] for implementation details). Using the BFS implementation as a starting point, we must now tweak it further by setting the `self.distance` attribute to the maximum possible value by default. We do this by importing the `sys` module and assigning `self.distance` to `sys.maxint`.

```python
import sys
  

class Vertex:
  
	def __init__(self, key):
		self.key = key
		self.connected_to = {}
		self.distance = sys.maxint # change
		self.visited = False
		self.fully_searched = False
		self.predecessor = None
		self.discovered = None
		self.finished = None

	[...]
```

Next we need a priority queue, which we implement by tweaking a [[What is a binary heap?|binary heap]] class:

```python
class PriorityQueue(BinaryHeap):
  

	def __init__(self):
		self.heap = [(0, None)] # (priority, value)
		self.current_size = 0
	
	def percolate_up(self, i):
		while i // 2 > 0:
			if self.heap_list[i][0] < self.heap_list[i // 2][0]:
				self.heap_list[i], self.heap_list[i // 2] = self.heap_list[i // 2], self.heap_list[i]
			i = i // 2
	
	def percolate_down(self, i):
		while (i * 2) <= self.current_size:
			min_child_idx = self.min_child(i)
			if self.heap_list[i][0] > self.heap_list[min_child_idx][0]:
				self.heap_list[i], self.heap_list[min_child_idx] = self.heap_list[min_child_idx], self.heap_list[i]
			i = min_child_idx
	  
	def insert(self, priority, value):
		self.heap.append((priority, value))
		self.current_size += 1
		self.percolate_up(self.current_size)
	  
	def heapify(self, arr):
		i = len(arr) // 2
		self.current_size = len(arr)
		heap_list = [(vx.get_distance(), vx) for vx in arr]
		self.heap = [(0, None)] + heap_list[:]
		while i > 0:
			self.percolate_down(i)
			i -= 1
	  
	def extract_min(self):
		min_val = self.heap_list[1][0]
		self.heap_list[1] = self.heap_list[self.current_size]
		self.current_size -= 1
		self.heap_list.pop()
		self.percolate_down(1)
		return min_val
	  
	def change_priority(self, vx, new_priority):
		for i in range(1, self.current_size + 1):
			if self.heap_list[i][1] == vx:
				self.heap_list[i] = (new_priority, vx)
				self.percolate_up(i)
				self.percolate_down(i)
				break
```

The changes made allow the priority queue to implement a heap structure which accepts tuples with the format `(priority, value)`, using `priority` as the key to order the heap with. The `self.heap` attribute establishes the `(priority, value)` format and the `percolate` methods index into the `priority` item within the tuple.

Finally, we can define Dijkstra's algorithm as follows:

```python
def dijkstra(graph, start):
	pq = PriorityQueue()
	start.distance = 0
	pq.heapify([(vx.distance, vx) for vx in graph])
	while pq.size > 0:
		current_vx = pq.extract_min()
		for neighbour in current_vx.get_connections():
			new_distance = current_vx.distance + current_vx.get_weight(neighbour)
			if new_distance < neighbour.distance:
				neighbour.distance = new_distance
				neighbour.predecessor = current_vx
				pq.change_priority(neighbour, new_distance)
```

The `dijkstra` function takes two arguments â€“ `graph`, a `Graph` object $G$, and `start`, a `Vertex` object $V$ where $V \in G$. The first step the algorithm takes is to initiate an empty priority queue. Next, the `distance` attribute of the starting vertex is set to 0 (by default it is set to `sys.maxint` on `Vertex` initiation). Next we use a list comprehension to loop through all the vertices in `graph` and create `(distance, vertex)` tuples for our `(priority, value)` priority queue. The resulting list of tuples is turned into a priority queue using the `heapify` method.

Next we open a `while` loop that will stop when the priority queue is empty â€“ it currently holds a `(distance, vertex)` tuple for each vertex in `graph`. Inside the loop, the first step is to extract the highest priority item in the priority queue â€“ the item with the smallest `distance`, which is currently `start` as every other vertex's `distance` attribute is `sys.maxint`. We loop through each neighbouring vertex around `start` and read the weight of the edge from `start` to each neighbour. We calculate a new `distance` value for each neighbour to be the current vertex's distance plus the weight of the edge leading from the current vertex to the neighbouring vertex, then, if the new distance is less than the distance currently assigned to the neighbouring vertex, we overwrite its `distance` attribute with the lesser value and update its `predecessor` pointer to point to the current vertex, as a shorter path has been identified. Finally, with the `distance` attribute changed, the neighbour's priority in the priority queue also needs to be changed so we call `change_priority` on the neighbour vertex to update its `distance` value within the priority queue tuple that represents it.

With one loop done, we go back to the start and the `current_vx` variable is updated to the next-closest vertex â€“ that is, the vertex with the smallest `distance` value still in the priority queue. Since we've just finished the first loop over the `start` vertex, this pass will consider all neighbours of the closest neighbour to `start`. The loop will continue, each time choosing the next-closest vertex to `start` in the graph, until all vertices have been explored and their `distance` and `predecessor` attributes updated accordingly. When the loop is done, every vertex will be marked with its total distance to the `start` vertex and its shortest path back to `start` can be followed by tracing the `predecessor` attribute, vertex to vertex.

The following images illustrate the process. Edges are represented by solid arrows, with their weight values labeled. Dotted arrows represent predecessor pointers.
