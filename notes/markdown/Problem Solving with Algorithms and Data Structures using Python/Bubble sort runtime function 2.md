# Bubble sort runtime function
Since the bubble sort algorithm relies on a nested loop to traverse each item in the list multiple times, the runtime function is $O(n^2)$. However, bubble sort has an advantage in cases where the list becomes sorted early. Due to its property of complete traversal of a list, the algorithm can be modified to detect when no swaps have occurred on a particular pass which means that all items are in order, and the algorithm can be cut short.
