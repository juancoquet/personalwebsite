# What is a greedy algorithm?
A greedy algorithm takes the most cost-efficient (cheapest) option at every step. For example, in a [[What is a graph?|graph]] path finding algorithm, a greedy variety would always opt to follow the edge with the lowest weight. Examples of greedy algorithms are [[Dijkstra's algorithm]] and [[Prim's algorithm]].
