# What is an ordered list?
An ordered list is a list whose items automatically maintain a logical order. For example, `5, 2, 3, 1, 4` would be an unordered list, but `1, 2, 3, 4, 5` is an ordered list (`5, 4, 3, 2, 1` would also be an ordered list). As new items are added to the ordered list, the logical order must be maintained. Because of the nature of ordered lists, it is assumed that a meaningful comparison operation exists between the list's items.
