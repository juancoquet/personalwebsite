# What is a base case?
The base case of a recursive algorithm is a condition that, when met, allows the algorithm to stop recursing. It is the condition that defines the bottom of the recursive spiral.

The base case typically describes a condition so simple that it can be solved trivially â€“ it is the simplest possible representation of a problem.
