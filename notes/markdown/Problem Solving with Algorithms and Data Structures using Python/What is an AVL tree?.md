# What is an AVL tree?
An AVL tree is a type of [[What is a binary search?|binary search]] tree that always remains balanced in order to prevent important tree functions such as `put` and `get` from deteriorating to $O(n)$ runtime, which would defeat the purpose of the tree. AVL stands for G.M. Adelson-Velskii and E.M. Landis, the names of its creators.

AVL trees maintain a balanced structure by keeping track of a **balance factor** â€“ a number that represents how the nodes of the tree are distributed between the left and right sub-trees, calculated by the following formula:
$$balanceFactor = height(leftSubTree) - height(rightRubTree)$$
A balance factor of 0 indicates a well-balanced tree, where the left sub-tree and the right sub-tree are the same height. A positive balance factor indicates that the tree is biased to the left, while a negative balance factor indicates that the tree is biased to the right.

An acceptable balance range needs to be specified â€“ a threshold value for the balance factor which, if breached, triggers a re-balancing of the tree to bring the balance factor back within the acceptable range. For this example, we will consider values between -1 and 1 (inclusive) to be balanced.

The following diagram shows the most unbalanced, but allowable, left-biased trees of heights 0, 1, 2, and 3, as specified by the above balance factor range:

In each case, the tree has a balance factor of 1 as the left sub-tree is has one more height level than the right. If another node is added to the far-left of the tree in any of the examples above, it would breach the allowed range and the tree would need rebalancing, which we achieve through [[Rebalancing a tree with rotations|tree rotations]].
