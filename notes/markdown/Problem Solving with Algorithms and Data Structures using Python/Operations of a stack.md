# Operations of a stack
- `push(item)` adds a new item to the top of the [[What is a stack?|stack]].
- `pop()` removes the top item from the stack and returns it.
- `peek()` returns the top item of the stack without removing it â€“ the stack remains unchanged.
- `is_empty()` is a boolean function to check if the stack is empty.
- `size()` returns the number of items in the stack.
