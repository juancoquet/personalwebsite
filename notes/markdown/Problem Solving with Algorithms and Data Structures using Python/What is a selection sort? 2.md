# What is a selection sort?
A selection sort algorithm passes through a list of $n$ items, $n-1$ times, and on each pass remembers the index of the highest-value item encountered. At the end of each pass, it places the highest-value item encountered in its correct position, at index $n-1-pass\:number$.
