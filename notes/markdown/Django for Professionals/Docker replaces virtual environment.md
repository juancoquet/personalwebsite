# Docker replaces virtual environment
When we use Docker, it effectively replaces our local virtual environment â€” we don't need to be in it anymore. Docker is also our database, and more if needed. The Docker host replaces our local operating system and within it we can run as many containers as needed for our app and for our database, all of which can be isolated and run separately.
