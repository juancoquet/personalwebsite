# Implementing login required behaviour
There are two easy ways of implementing login required behaviour when a view is called â€” either with the `@login_required` decorator if using a function-based view, or with the `LoginRequiredMixin` if using a class-based view. Below we implement it using the mixin.
```python
# views.py

from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin


class MyView(LoginRequiredMixin):
	...
	login_url = 'account_login'

```

We first import `LoginRequiredMixin`, then we make our view inherit from it. The last step is to provide `login_url`, the name of the URL where we want the site to redirect the user to if they are not logged in when calling this view.

We use `account_login` assuming that we have used `django-allauth` for our authentication system, otherwise it would simply be `login` if we were using Django's built in `auth`.
