# Customising password change and reset pages
`django-allauth` comes with both a password change and a password reset page built in. We can modify these the same way we did in [[Customising email confirmation page]] â€” we find where the page exists in the Github repository and then create our own version of the file where we copy the boilerplate and modify as desired.
