# Documenting modules
Each module should begin with a docstring to introduce the module and its contents. This is done by using three double quotes """. The first line should describe the module's overall purpose, with subsequent lines and paragraphs containing any details that the user should know about its operation. Any important classes and functions should be highlighted here.
