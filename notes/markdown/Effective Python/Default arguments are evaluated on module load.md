# Default arguments are evaluated on module load
Default arguments are only evaluated when the module loads. This can create surprising results when a default value needs to be evaluated each time the function is called, such as a `datetime.now()` default value. To circumvent this, assign the default value to `None` and use the following syntax to force the default argument to be evaluated each time the function is called.
```
if keyword is None:
	keyword = datetime.now()
```
