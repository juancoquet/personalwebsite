# Using community modules
Python's central library of modules can be found at https://pypi.org. PyPI stands for Python Package Index, and it's a great place to look for code when you encounter a new challengeâ€”there may well exist code already that helps you achieve your goals.

Packages can be installed using `pip` in the command line, which stands for the recursive phrase "pip installs packages". The command to run is `python3 -m pip isntall package_name`. Be sure to do this within your virtual environment if that is where your project resides.
