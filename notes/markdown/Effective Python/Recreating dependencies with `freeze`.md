# Recreating dependencies with `freeze`
If you need to transfer a project elsewhere, such as a server in a database or another workstation, all dependencies will need to be available on the destination system in order to successfully use the projectâ€”all required packages need to be installed. This is made easy with the `pip freeze` command, which will write all dependencies to a file which is called `requirements.txt` by convention.
```
(myproject) $ python3 -m pip freeze > requirements.txt
(myproject) $ cat requirements.txt
numpy==1.16.2
requests==2.21.0
urllib3==1.24.1
```

This file can then be used in another virtual environment to install all required dependencies by using `-m pip install -r` on the `requirements.txt` file inside the new virtual environment.
```
(otherproject) $ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
(otherproject) $ python3 -m pip list
numpy==1.16.2
requests==2.21.0
urllib3==1.24.1
```
