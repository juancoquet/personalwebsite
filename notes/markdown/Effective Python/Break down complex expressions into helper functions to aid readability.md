# Break down complex expressions into helper functions to aid readability
Complex logical expressions can hurt the readability of your code, so you should consider abstracting these expressions into helper functionsâ€”especially if you find that you're repeating yourself.

While python allows for very terse code to be written, shorter is not always better if it comes at the cost of readability (as it often does). Just because you can maximally optimise the length of a line through clever code doesn't mean that you should, as you could be hurting the overall readability of the code.
