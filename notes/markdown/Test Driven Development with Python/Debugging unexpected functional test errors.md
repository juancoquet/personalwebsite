# Debugging unexpected functional test errors
There are four key methods we can use to debug an unexpected functional test:
- Adding print statements to give us clues about what is going wrong.
- Improving the messages of the errors.
- Manually visit the site (as opposed to using Selenium).
- Use `time.sleep()` to pause the test during execution.
