# Big Design Up Front vs Agile and Minimum Viable Application
*Big Design Up Front* means that you begin with a detailed schematic of what your app should doâ€”it is as it sounds. The problem with this is that it isn't always easy to know what problems you will encounter until you're actually developing the app. By contrast, the *Agile* philosophy is that you learn more from solving problems in development than in theory, particularly when you have access to user feedback. For this reason, Agile development focuses on developing a *minimum viable application*â€”a version of the application that is minimally viable, and iterates on that with subsequent versions making improvements based on user feedback.

Test Driven Development is well aligned with Agile programming.
