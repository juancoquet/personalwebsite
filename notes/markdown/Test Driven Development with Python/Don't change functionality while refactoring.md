# Don't change functionality while refactoring
Refactoring code can be a very confusing process. It is very important to completely separate the refactoring process from changing functionality to avoid losing track of what the code is meant to be doing. It is best to keep the refactoring process to small, methodical steps, never skipping ahead. Any potential time saved by skipping ahead and making large changes risks putting you severely behind if you get yourself tangled up in unwieldy code.
