# How to make Fleeting Notes
Fleeting notes are captures of quick thoughts and ideas that come to you throughout the day. The key word really is *fleeting*â€”these should not be cause for distraction and should not take time or effort to get down. They should simply serve as a reminder of a thought or idea which can be processed later on, ideally in the same day when you can recall the essence of the thought with clarity.
Fleeting notes should be funneled into one place where they can be assessed later on. Keep them all together to make the process seamless.
