# Use tags with connections in mind, never in isolation
When tags must be used (see [[Use tags selectively and sparingly]]), use them to place the current note into the context of your broader thinking. Never decide on a tag by looking at the note in isolation. Ask yourself which broader questions and lines of thought the note could apply to, and tag appropriately.
