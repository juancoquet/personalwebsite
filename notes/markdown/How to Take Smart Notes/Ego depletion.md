# Ego depletion
Ego depletion is the term used to refer to a temporary reduction in the capacity to engage in volitional actionâ€”the capacity to execute acts of *willpower*. This includes choice-making and acts of self-control. Engaging in such volitional actions interferes with acts that follow soon after, indicating that there is a kind of resource being depleted with each occurrence of volitional action. The rates and causes of replenishment of this resource remain unknown.
