# The normal educational system doesn't leverage the way we really learn
It is by trying (and often *failing*) to make sense of what we encounter that we truly learn. We try to figure out how the new things we encounter fit into the bigger picture of our already found knowledgeâ€”we make *connections*.

Normal schooling (particularly the testing aspect) simply presents students with deeply categorized (*disconnected*) information and tests their ability to memorise and regurgitate factoids on a given date. It doesn't often try to get to the roots of *understanding*. This means that normal schooling is somewhat optimised to facilitate the short-term memorising of information instead of a true *understanding*â€”it asks students to *memorise*, not to *think*.
