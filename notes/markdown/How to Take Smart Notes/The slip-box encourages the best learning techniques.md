# The slip-box encourages the best learning techniques
We learn primarily by doing three thingsâ€”elaborating on ideas, making connections and retrieving information. This is what encodes knowledge into our brain for the long run. The slip box helps us do all three of these by asking us to write notes, develop them into permanent notes and finally connect them to existing notes. Writing literature notes and permanent notes ensures that we elaborate on ideas, while connecting them to existing notes appends these ideas to our broader latticework of thought and causes us to attempt to retrieve information that may be related when we are thinking about what the notes should connect to.
