# Good tools reduce distractions from the main work
Good tools, whatever the purpose, should reduce distractions from the main work as much as possibleâ€”not add them for the sake of complexity. When it comes to the slip-box, the main task is *thinking*, which the slip-box should encourage you to do rather than causing friction. The slip-box should provide a gentle structureâ€”an external scaffoldingâ€”to your thinking to remedy the weaknesses of the human brain for storing information.
