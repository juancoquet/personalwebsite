# Not needing to use willpower is better than having strong willpower

The best way to get lots done is by removing any resistance that stands in the way of the completion of tasks and habits. Becoming hyper productive is not so much about being able to force oneself into doing lots but rather eliminating barriers and *making it easy* to get lots done.

Your environment should set you up for success, not stand in your way. This applies to productivity and also to success in general. The key to success is not to overcome resistance, but to remove resistance as much as possible within your working environment. (Chapter 1.2)
