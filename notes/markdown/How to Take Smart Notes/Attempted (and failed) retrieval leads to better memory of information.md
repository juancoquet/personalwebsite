# Attempted (and failed) retrieval leads to better memory of information
By attempting to recollect a piece of information we improve our ability to remember it in the long term, even if the retrieval attempt failed. It's the effort made that counts, not the outcome.

For this reason, retrieval is a better method of learning than cramming, which often only leads to short-term memory.
