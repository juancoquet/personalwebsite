# Write about developed ideas
Look for where clusters of notes have built up over time and consider these clusters as potential writing topics. Open these notes in sequence and think about what is there and what is missing. Try to go looking for what is missing by reading more to fill in the gaps.
After viewing these notes in order and assessing their completeness, they can then be turned into a rough draft. Turn them into coherent text that connects all these ideas in sequence. You may detect flaws in your arguments as you writeâ€”correct these and continueâ€”you are still developing.
Flesh out arguments where they are lacking depth (although the notes should already mostly contain sufficient bolstering) and proof read the finished work.
