# Always write down the outcome of your thinking
After thinking through an idea, always write down the outcome including any possible connections to other lines of thought and further inquiries. This makes it easy to pick up from where you left off when you come back to the subject matter, and it means that you do not need to keep mentally taxing ideas bouncing around in your head.
