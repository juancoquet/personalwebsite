# See through the context of the original text
The ability to spot patterns, identify and question the frames used and identify the distinctions made by the writer (what is *meant* and what *isn't meant?*) are the characteristics; the precursors of critical thought. It is about being able to see past the context and any present biases and address the idea directly at its core.
