# Most readers still operate with a 'pre-shipping-container' mindset
Many students, writers, and learners more generally are still using old systems of note-taking that are far less than optimal when considering the bigger picture. They think "why bother taking long notes when it makes reading so much slower?" but they do not take into account what they actually gain from solely reading vs reading and writing.

Of those who do read and write, few organise their knowledge in a useful way. Most notes are doomed to forever exist in old pages of notebooks and book margins, never to be found again. It's by properly organising notes into a system like the slip-box that the whole process becomes optimised at a higher level of emergence, meaning that knowledge learned can then be intelligibly used and easily applied in the right contexts.
