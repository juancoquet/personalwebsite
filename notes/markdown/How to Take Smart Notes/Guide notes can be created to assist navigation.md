# Guide notes can be created to assist navigation
When a particular subject emerges from the slip-box, many notes can bundle up together. If it starts to become unwieldy, a guide note can be created as a kind of local index for that area of the slip-box. It can contain links to many notes in the surrounding area along with a few words explaining what can be found by following those links.
