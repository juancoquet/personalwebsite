# Make efforts to write down arguments that oppose your views
By writing down counter-views to your own, you force yourself to really consider them and pitch them up against your own convictions. It allows you to really put your ideas to the test and improve them by not being able to dismiss criticism when it arises. It also means that when these counter-arguments come up in conversation, they will not be new and you will have already put a good deal of thought into them.
