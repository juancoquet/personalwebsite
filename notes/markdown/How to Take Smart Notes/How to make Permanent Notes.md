# How to make Permanent Notes
Permanent notes are most often derived from fleeting notes and literature notes. These are mainly your own thoughts and ideas sparked by reading other sources.
Read through your literature notes and fleeting notes (ideally on the same day they were made) and think about how these relate to your own thinking. Think about how they fit in to the dialogues occurring in the slip-box. Here, the aim is to develop ideas rather than simply collect themâ€”what questions arise from these thoughts? What connections, obvious or less so, can be made to other thoughts? Does this idea support or oppose other ideas within the slip-box? Does this idea fit into any different contexts? *How is this important in my own lines of thought?*

Fleeting notes can be discarded once processed into permanent notes.

Always write permanent notes as if you are writing them for somebody else. You need to make sure that you'll understand exactly what they are about when you stumble into them again in the future in different contexts.
