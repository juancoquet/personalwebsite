# The length of literature notes is variable
How long a literature note should be depends on several factors. The complexity of the original text is a key factorâ€”more complex ideas will take more writing to understand and distill. It also depends on the note-taker's ability to be conciseâ€”expert note takers can accurately capture ideas with fewer words than novices. Finally, another factor is the note-taker's familiarity with the subject at handâ€”well understood subjects may not require lengthy notes, while new subjects most certainly will.

The important thing is not the length of these notes, but *how well they serve the purpose of aiding the writing of permanent notes.*
