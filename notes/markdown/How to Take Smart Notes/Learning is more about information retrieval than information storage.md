# Learning is more about information retrieval than information storage
Storage alone doesn't get us very far. All the knowledge in the world is useless if we can't retrieve it when we need it, that is to say, retrieve it in the right context. Learning should be about building connections between the different facets of our knowledgeâ€”ensuring that the right cues connect the the relevant knowledge. Any piece of information can become the cue for another piece of information.

The slip-box allows us to build a network of interlocked ideas and thoughts that serve as cues for each other.
