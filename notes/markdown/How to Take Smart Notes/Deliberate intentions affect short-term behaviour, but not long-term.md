# Deliberate intentions affect short-term behaviour, but not long-term
What we intend to do has an effect on what we *actually* do only in the very close short term. If I intend to do something now, chances are that I will actually do it. This doesn't translate very well to the long-term thoughâ€”what I intend to do in three months does not have much bearing on what I will actually do.
