# The Zettelkasten system relies on two types of notesâ€”Literature Notes and Permanent Notes
Literature notes are used to take notes on books, papers and other mediums. They are an attempt to capture the ideas behind the text you read. They are later used as a bibliographical index for navigating the slip-box.

Permanent notes are for generating and capturing ideas based on what you read. This often occurs in response to a literature note.
