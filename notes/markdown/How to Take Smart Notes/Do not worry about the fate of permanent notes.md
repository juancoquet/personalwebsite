# Do not worry about the fate of permanent notes
It is not possible to foresee future developments of the slip-box, so do not worry about where new permanent notes will end up â€” simply make relevant connections now and submit them.

They may never find links or they may become central notes in the future, all that matters is that they are put into the slip-box.
