# Writing about what you read makes you more intelligent
Even if you never write an academic paper, an article, a book or even a blog post with the notes you take, writing about what you read will improve the quality of your thinking, improve your reading and improve many other intellectual skills.
All these benefits come from acting as if [[Writing is all that counts]].
