# Writing is not an inhibition to reading
It is true that writing as you read will mean you get through a book more slowly, but it is also true that doing so will make having gotten through the book actually worthwhile.
The idea that reading, thinking, understanding and writing are separate tasks leads to the belief that writing will take away time from doing the others (namely readingâ€”why waste time writing instead of reading another book?). This is a false belief, as the only way to think about and understand what you read is through writing. It is all the same process; *the same task*.
