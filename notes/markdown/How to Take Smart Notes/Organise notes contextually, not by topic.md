# Organise notes contextually, not by topic
When deciding where a note should be connected, think *"In what context will I want to stumble upon this again?"*

Organising by topic means that you will only find notes that you deliberately search for, whereas making contextual connections within the slip-box will present you with ideas which may have been long forgotten when they become relevant. This allows your brain to focus on its strengthsâ€”*thinking* instead of remembering.
