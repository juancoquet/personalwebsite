# The shipping container parable
Before shipping containers existed, shipped goods were off-loaded from trucks and loosely packed into freighter ships. When containers were first introduced, ship owners were reluctant to adopt their use as they were used to their old ways and couldn't see past the immediate downside of adapting to shipping containersâ€”having to unpack and shuffle around items to and from different containers depending on their destination, among other inconveniences. It seemed inefficient in their view.

But it was not their narrow view that really mattered. What mattered was streamlining the shipping process from manufacturer to consumerâ€”streamlining the overarching pipeline. A positive feedback loop occurred when the advantages began to become apparent. More harbours capable of handling containers were built, which meant more container ships were needed, which meant shipping became cheaper, which meant one could ship further affordably, creating more demand and so on.
