# Ideas can exist in different contexts
When you're reading you encounter ideas that serve a particular purpose within the context of the writer's arguments. They exist as someone else's thought process, supporting their argument by using their words. This is why it is very important to translate these ideas into our own thinking through literature notes and permanent notes. However, be aware that the freedom to translate is the freedom to define the original thoughts and ideas as truly and accurately as possibleâ€”*not* the freedom to modify and make fit.

When the essence of an idea has been distilled through a literature note, we can now turn to the slip-box and ask how it fits into our own thinking.
