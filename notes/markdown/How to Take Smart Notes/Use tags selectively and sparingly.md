# Use tags selectively and sparingly
Tags should not be overused within notes. This has the tendency to lead to over-categorisation, which we do not want for the purpose of the slip-box. They should be used *very* selectively and sparingly as the slip-box is not a tool for archiving but rather a tool for thinkingâ€”the links between notes are therefore far more important than tags.
