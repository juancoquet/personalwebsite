# Reduce the number of decisions by using your note system in a consistent way
By using our slip-box in a routine wayâ€”literature notes then permanent notes, all styled in the same mannerâ€”we reduce the number of decisions that need to be made when working on a project. We can also retrieve information from the slip-box in a uniform way.

This mindset also applies to the tools peripheral to the slip box. Always capture fleeting notes on the same platform/notebook. Always capture literature notes on the same platform. Always capture permanent notes on the same platform. Use the same workflows every time.
