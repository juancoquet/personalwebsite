# Good readers read beyond the frames of a text
The difference between good readers and poor readers; good students and poor students, is the ability to think beyond the scope of the text. Those who are better at reading read with questions in mind and try to fit the ideas being read into their own model of thinking, they don't take the text in at face value. They spot what is missing from the text just as much as what is present.
