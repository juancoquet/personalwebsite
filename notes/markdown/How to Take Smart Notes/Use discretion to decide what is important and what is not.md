# Use discretion to decide what is important and what is not
The text we read will only serve us with informationâ€”it will not decide for us what is and isn't important to our thinking. It is up to us to decide what belongs in the slip box and what doesn't. We must use our own capacities of thought to discern what matters and what doesn't when considering the relevance of new information to the bigger picture of our latticework of ideas.
