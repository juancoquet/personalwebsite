# All our good ideas are contained in the slip-box
Since we've been writing alongside reading, all our good ideas will be contained in the slip box. This means that it's easy to pick a topic to write about, because we'll be able to see where clusters of notes have built up. It is much better to come up with good ideas to write about this wayâ€”over the course of reading for several monthsâ€”than it is to come up with good ideas by trying to brainstorm.
