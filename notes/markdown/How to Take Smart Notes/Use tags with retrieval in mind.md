# Use tags with retrieval in mind
When tags need to be used (see [[Use tags selectively and sparingly]]), think about in what context the note should be stumbled intoâ€”not where it should ideally be stored. You are not trying to archive information, you are trying to enable future thinking.

Do not think "which tag would be the best fit?"; rather think "in what *context* will I want to stumble upon this note, even if I forget about it?"
