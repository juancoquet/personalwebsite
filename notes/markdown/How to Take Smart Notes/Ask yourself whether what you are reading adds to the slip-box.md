# Ask yourself whether what you are reading adds to the slip-box
While reading, the slip-box forces you into a selective note-taking mode. You must be looking for things that add something of worth to the slip-box. Whether that is a new idea, a contradiction, a new connection or a new question, the only criterion is that it either *connects* to something or it is *open to connections in the future*.
