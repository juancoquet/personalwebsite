# Having writing at the centre of attention will change the way you read
Having writing as your main concern while reading books and other media will mean that you read with more focus and precision as you are on the lookout for the key points which must be captured. It forces you to be more engaged with what you are reading as you can't possibly write about it if you skim without understanding.
The step of writing permanent notes means that you will elaborate on the meaning behind the text, making it more likely that you will remember what you read.
