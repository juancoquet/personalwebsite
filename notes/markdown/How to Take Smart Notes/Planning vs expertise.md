# Planning vs expertise
Experts do not need rigid plansâ€”they can adapt in real-time. Making rigid plans puts you on rails. It's better to be an expert than a planner.

Experts have internalised knowledge through continuous practice, meaning that they can rely on their finely tuned intuitions to make decisions in complex situations. This reduces the need for rigid plans, which put you in awkward situations when circumstances inevitably change.

As Mike Tyson once saidâ€”*"Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth."*
