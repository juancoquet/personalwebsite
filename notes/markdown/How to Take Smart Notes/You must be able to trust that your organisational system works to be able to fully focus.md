# You must be able to trust that your organisational system works to be able to fully focus
If you don't trust that everything that needs to be taken care of *will* be taken care of once it is in your system, you will not be able to fully focus on the task at hand as you won't be able to put small pending tasks off your mind.

Only by being able to trust the robustness and reliability of your system 100% will you be able to let go of everything that has been submitted to your system and focus fully on the present task, with no distractions.
