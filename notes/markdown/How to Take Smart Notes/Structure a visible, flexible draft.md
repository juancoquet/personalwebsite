# Structure a visible, flexible draft
When putting together a draft, the two key things to keep in mind are to make it *visible* and to keep it *flexible*. Good visibility allows you to get a good overview of what is included in each section, while keeping it flexible allows you to make changes where needed as you write. A draft is not about deciding once and for all what will be included in each section, but rather about choosing what does *not* need to be included. This keeps the text linear and to the point, as it allows you to see what comes up where in order to structure your text accordingly.
